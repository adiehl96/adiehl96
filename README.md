### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my github page. Below you can find the most interesting projects that I have worked on and that can be shared online. 

## Implementation of a Distributed Minimum Dominating Set Approximation Algorithm in a Spiking Neural Network
An additional project I've contributed towards and which has led to a publication, can be found [here](https://github.com/a-t-0/spiking-neural-network-of-dominating-set-approximation). The publication can be found in the [pre-proceedings of BNAIC2021](https://bnaic2021.uni.lu/programme/).
